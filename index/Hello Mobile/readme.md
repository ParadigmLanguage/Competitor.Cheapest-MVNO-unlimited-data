Bad Release Engineering & Deployment:  
"I work with large deployment internet software. We would never push changes to all our users without going through a select group who has volunteered to be testers for us. If they survive we start pushing to the world in batches. I can just say that if we created a cluster**** like the one HM put themselves into we would not survive. I hope HM does. I'll wait. I just hope we aren't all losing our numbers going down with HM. That would really suck."
